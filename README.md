The application allows you to reproduce informative sections for each of the areas of the site. This can be done using two different methods:

* **Vuforia**: Using Vuforia, the application allows you to detect markers on which the informative sections can be reproduced.

Finally, the minigame allows the user to place a sign that indicates what type of room would correspond to the displayed area
based on the object that had been unearthed there. The user will be able to see if the sign placed is correct by means of a
symbol that will appear on the sign when it is placed.
