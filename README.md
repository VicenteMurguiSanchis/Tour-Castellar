# Tour-Castellar
Tour Castellar is a mobile application that serves as a tourist
guide for the Iberian site of **El Castellar** located in the municipality of
Casinos. Application makes use of **augmented reality** technology to show 
recreations of buildings and elements of the site, while offering information about the 
historical context of the place to provide users with a high quality experience.

The application allows you to reproduce informative sections for each of the areas of the site. This is done using two different methods:

* **Vuforia**: Using Vuforia the application allows you to detect markers on which the informative sections may be reproduced.


* **AR Foundation Plane Detector**: With AR Foundation, users can choose where they want to play the section.



The sections show a fictional character named Aretaunin, who offers users the information in the section based 
on images and digital recreations of the structures and elements of the place.


The app also offers two mini-games that users can interact with while learning.

* **First Minigame**: The first minigame allows the user to place a series of areas in which they can unearth objects.


After this, the player can locate the buried objects and extract them with the object detector.



Once the object has been unearthed, the user will be able to investigate and find out what kind of object they have discovered.



Finally, the minigame allows the user to place a sign that indicates what type of room would correspond to the displayed area
based on the object that had been unearthed there. The user will be able to see if the sign placed is correct by means of a
symbol that will appear on the sign when it is placed.



* **Second Minigame**: The second minigame allows users to place different Iberian objects/furniture typical of the time in a certain area.


Once the objects have been placed, the user can obtain information about each of the objects.

The application is intended to be used at the site, but the different sections can be reproduced anywhere using the AR Foundation plane detector.
